In "The Lion King," Simba's birth is a joyous occasion, marking the arrival of the future king and the continuation of the Pride Lands' lineage. The ceremony, led by Rafiki, the shaman, presents the newborn cub to all the animals, signifying the "Circle of Life". This event is crucial as it establishes Simba as Mufasa's heir and Scar's rival for the throne.

Simba is presented as the son of King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi. 

**Ceremony and Significance:**

The ceremony, led by Rafiki, takes place at Pride Rock and is a grand display for all the animals of the Pride Lands.

When Scar pushed his brother to a stampede of antelopes, Mufasa died in stampede but saved Simba 's life.
Scar made Simba belive that Simba was responsible for his father's death and told him to run away.

Then Simba ran far away as he could , very far from the Pride Lands.
Then he reached a dessert where he ran out of energy and was lying down hoplessly.
Then a meercat ( Timon ) and a wild pig ( Pumbaa ) found him and carried him to their home.
Simba agrees to live with them and so many years passes by.

## Return of Simba

As when Simba grows to an young adult he meets Nala and she tells that Scar has taken over the Pride Lands.
On his way to the Pride Lands, he Meets Rafiki where he tells that he should be the king of the Pride Lands and not Scar.
Simba doesn't feel much hope.
It is then his father appears in the sky and gives him advice "  Remember who you are. You are my son and the one true king. Remember who you are."

Nala guided Simba to the pride lands.
He also took Timon & Pumbaa along with his journey.

At the pride rock, Simba sees his mother, exhausted and tired of hunting.
At that moment, Scar comes and he was haunted upon seeing Simba.
Then Scar tells Simba to tell the secret of his father.
Wher Sarabi heard this, she fell down out of shock.
Then Scar fights Simba and tried to push him down.

Then, Scar tells the truth silently to Simba.

Simba gets furious and pounces on Scar and forces his uncle to tell the truth.

When Simba got Scar sorrounded at the end of the pride rock , Scar put the blame on the hyenas that they are the ones who killed Mufasa.
But Simba didn't believe.
He roared at Scar and lunges on him.
